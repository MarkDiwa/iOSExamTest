# iOSExamTest

To run the App:

1. Run **pod install** or **arch -x86_64 pod install** for M1 Macs.
2. Open the workspace to run.


For improvements:
1. I still have to apply pagination for the user feeds as I'm still figuring it out in Firebase Firestore.
2. Add Post/Feed detail view controller.
3. Add Like and Comment Functionality.
4. Maybe update Linter Rules.
5. Add chat functionality for fun.
6. Better super class for view controller that needs to present activity indicator.
7. Add Profile pictures.


Thank you for the opportunity :D
