# iOSExamTest

To run the App:

1. Run **pod install** or **arch -x86_64 pod install** for M1 Macs.
2. Open the workspace to run.


For improvements:
1. I still have to apply pagination for the user feeds as I'm still figuring it out in Firebase Firestore.
2. Add Post/Feed detail view controller.
3. Add Like and Comment Functionality.
